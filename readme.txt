light, easy to read and to display content with objectiveness with some cool
features to improve user experience.

* Category and tag carousel widgets
* Inline indication for internal/external links
* Automatic title anchoring

* Option to hide the title for some categories and give them

Icons
-----

Monospace2 reads the `icon` directory in the theme root and gives you the
option to associate them with categories, so they will be displayed in the side
of the posts that have that category assigned.

Any icon in the `icon` directory will be interpreted by Monospace2 as long as
the file name follow the pattern `<any name>&<size>.png` with a hover version
`<any name>&<size>-hover.png`.

The default icons of the theme are from the [Brightmix Icon
Set](http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset%3Abrightmix), licensed under
the WTPL License (GPL compatible).
