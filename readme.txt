features to improve user experience.

Icons
-----

Monospace2 reads the `icon` directory in the theme root and gives you the
option to associate them with categories, so they will be displayed in the side
of the posts that have that category assigned.

To make any icon to be interpreted by Monospace2 and appear on the options
menu, create these files with the `<any name>` prefix you want, and put them in
the `icon` directory.
